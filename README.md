<h2>Update Instructions:</h2>
* V3.1.x -> V3.2.x
  * Everything fine! Nothing todo.
* V3.0.6 -> V3.1.x
  * Delete the assets Folder inside the Plugin.
* Before V3.0.6
  * Plugin Settings need to be revisited. 
* Before V3.0.3
  * Delete this folder joomla-root/plugins/system/jooag_shariff/backend/cache
  * Not so important to delete this folder. It's not needed anymore, because we use the Joomla Core Cache folder.
* Before V3.0.0 Stable
  * Delete the old Plugin and install the new one

<h4>Share Counter:</h4>
It's really important for the counter to use the url only with www or non-www.
<h6>To redirect www to non-www do the following steps:</h6>
<ol>
<li>Rename the htaccess.txt in your joomla root folder to .htaccess</li>
<li>Add following lines in the end of the .htaccess file</li>
<pre>
# www to non-www
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.(.*)$ [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://%1/$1 [R=301,L]
</pre>
or
<pre>
# non-www to www
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\.
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.%{HTTP_HOST}/$1 [R=301,L]
</pre>
<li>At least you need to open this plugin and save it again!</li>
</code>
</ol>
</p>
